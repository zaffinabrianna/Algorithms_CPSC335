Brianna Zaffina & Suanna Shih readme:

To perform our code, follow these steps:
1. Upload all three of our files into your IDE (main.cpp, Algorithm1.h, Algo2.h) or open the directory of the files (depending on your IDE)
2. Run the code

Exhaustive Search (Part A) Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
1
Using exhaustive search:
{10, {1, 3}}

Dynamic Programming (Part B) Expected Output:
Which part do you want to test? Enter the letter (char). (A or B)
b
Using dynammic programing:
____________________________________________
Our budget is 10.
Let's find the total amount of stocks we can get with our budget!
Our 2D Array: [1,2], [3,3], [5,6], [6,7].

RESULTS:
[10, [1,3]]
Where 10 is the total cost, where 1 is the index of [3, 3] and where 3 is the index of [6, 7].
Our maximum total stocks within our budget is: 9

Boom! You're finished. main.cpp should compile test cases for all the requirements.
If you would like to add more test cases:

For Algorithm1:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 1" of the switch statement
	Add your test case in a similar format to the previous test cases.
For Algorithm2:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 2" of the switch statement
	Add your test case in a similar format to the previous test cases.
