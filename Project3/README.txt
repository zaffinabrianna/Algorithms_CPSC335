Brianna Zaffina & Suanna Shih readme:

To perform our code, follow these steps:
1. Upload all three of our files into your IDE (main.cpp, Algorithm1.h, Algo2.h) or open the directory of the files (depending on your IDE)
2. Run the code

Algorithm 1 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
1
Test 1:
=========================================
Maximum Total Charm Achievable Under the Weight Constraint is: 15.00

Test 2:
=========================================
Maximum Total Charm Achievable Under the Weight Constraint is: 10.00

Test 3:
=========================================
ERROR: Weight is not in-between 1 and 1000000.

Maximum Total Charm Achievable Under the Weight Constraint is: -1.00

Test 4:
=========================================
ERROR: Number of beads is not in-between 1 and 100.

Maximum Total Charm Achievable Under the Weight Constraint is: -1.00

Algorithm 2 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
2
Bottle day: Day 2
Sold day: Day 5
Total value: 5

Bottle day: Day 4
Sold day: Day 2
Total value: 0

Bottle day: Day 5
Sold day: Day 8
Total value: 89

Boom! You're finished. main.cpp should compile test cases for all the requirements.
If you would like to add more test cases:

For Algorithm1:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 1" of the switch statement
	Add your test case in a similar format to the previous test cases.
For Algorithm2:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 2" of the switch statement
	Add your test case in a similar format to the previous test cases.
