Brianna Zaffina & Suanna Shih readme:

To perform our code, follow these steps:
1. Upload all three of our files into your IDE (main.cpp, Algorithm1.h, Algorithm2.h) or open the directory of the files (depending on your IDE)
2. Run the code

Algorithm 1 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
1


Algorithm 2 Expected Output:
Which Algorithm do you want to test? Enter the number. (1 or 2)
2


Boom! You're finished. main.cpp should compile test cases for all the requirements.
If you would like to add more test cases:

For Algorithm1:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 1" of the switch statement
	If you are trying to do user input, ...
For Algorithm2:
	Inside main.cpp, add your test cases inside the "case 2" of the switch statement
